### Title Popularity

### Creator Insights
7. **Popular Contributors**: Kiefer Sutherland is the top contributor, with 48 entries. This suggests he is a prolific figure within the dataset, possibly reflecting a trend in which certain actors or filmmakers leave a significant mark on the data through their works.

### Rating Insights

9. **Quality Ratings**: The average quality rating of approximately 3.21 indicates that, while the content is generally received well, there is room for improvement in perceived quality.
10. **Repeatability Scores**: With a mean repeatability score of about 1.49, most entries are likely one-time views, suggesting either that many films may not be considered re-watchable or that the dataset captures first impressions.

### Distribution of Ratings
11. **Median Ratings**: The 50th percentile (median) for both overall and quality ratings is 3.0, indicating that half of the entries rated below or at 3.0, reaffirming the suggestion of a fairly modest level of satisfaction across the dataset.

### Recommendations for Further Analysis
